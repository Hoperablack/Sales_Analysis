# Sales Analysis for Company XYZ

## Project Overview

Company XYZ has experienced a decline in sales performance over the past few months. This project aims to analyze the company's sales data to identify the reasons behind the decline and provide actionable insights to improve sales. The analysis covers 12 months of sales data, including transactions from various cities, product types, and purchase times.

## Business Questions Answered

This analysis answers the following business-level questions:

1. **Best Month for Sales**: 
   - What was the best month for sales?
   - How much was earned during that month?

2. **Top Selling City**:
   - Which city sold the most products?

3. **Optimal Advertisement Timing**:
   - What time should advertisements be displayed to maximize the likelihood of customer purchases?

4. **Frequently Sold Products Together**:
   - Which products are most often sold together?

5. **Top-Selling Product**:
   - Which product sold the most?
   - Why did it sell the most?

## Data Sources

The project utilizes 12 months of sales data provided by Company XYZ. The dataset contains information on electronics store purchases, including the month of purchase, product type, cost, purchase address, and more.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

To prepare the data for analysis, the following steps were taken:

- **Merging Monthly Data**: Combined data from each month into a single DataFrame.
- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Dropped rows with missing values.
  - Removed rows based on specific conditions.
  - Converted column data types (e.g., `to_numeric`, `to_datetime`, `astype`).
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created a new column for the month of purchase.
  - Created a new column for the city based on the purchase address.

## Analysis and Visualization

The analysis is primarily done using Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. The following visualizations are included:

- **Bar Graphs**: Used to display the best month for sales, top-selling cities, and the most frequently sold products.
- **Line Graphs**: Used to identify the optimal time for displaying advertisements.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the best-performing months, cities with the highest sales, optimal times for advertising, and product performance. These insights can be used by Company XYZ to strategize and improve sales performance.
